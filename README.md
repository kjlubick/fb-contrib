fb-contrib
==========

a FindBugs plugin for doing static code analysis on java byte code. 
For information see http://fb-contrib.sf.net
This is a fork from https://github.com/mebigfatguy/fb-contrib

This fork is dealing mainly with usability concerns such as modifying BugRanks and confidences so this plugin is more compatible with workflows already established with FindBugs.  

Improvements to the messages will be made and, occasionally, some of my own detectors will be added.
